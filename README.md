# Landolfio
Django-based asset tracking system

## Getting started

This project is built using the [Django](https://github.com/django/django) framework. [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) is used for dependency management.

### Setup

0. Get at least [Python](https://www.python.org) 3.7 installed on your system.
1. Clone this repository.
2. If ```pip3``` is not installed on your system yet, execute ```apt install python3-pip``` on your system.
3. Also make sure ```python3-dev``` is installed on your system, execute ```apt install python3-dev```.
4. Install Poetry by following the steps on [their website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation). Make sure poetry is added to ```PATH``` before continuing.
5. Make sure `poetry` uses your python 3 installation: `poetry env use python3`.
6. Run `poetry install` to install all dependencies.
7. Run `poetry shell` to start a shell with the dependencies loaded. This command needs to be ran every time you open a new shell and want to run the development server.
8. Run ```cd website``` to change directories to the ```website``` folder containing the project.
9. Run ```./manage.py migrate``` to initialise the database and run all migrations.
10. Run ```./manage.py createsuperuser``` to create an administrator that is able to access the backend interface.
11. Run ```./manage.py runserver``` to start the development server locally.

Now your server is setup and running on ```localhost:8000```. The administrator interface can be accessed by going to ```localhost:8000/admin```.
